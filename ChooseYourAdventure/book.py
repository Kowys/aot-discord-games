This game depicts the Battle of Trost, seen in Volumes 1-4 of the Attack on Titan manga.\n\n\
There are a number of possible endings.\n\n\
Depending on your choices, you may receive a worse ending than that in the manga: humanity may be defeated, or \
characters who survived in the original version may die.\n\n\
On the other hand, if you manage to survive the fight, you may get different endings based on your **Affinity** \
with various characters.\n\n\
There is even the possibility that, if you solve the puzzles and truly distinguish yourself, the story may \
develop or conclude differently from the original; you may even be able to save your friends from a brutal \
death.\n\n\
‚ùóAt any point in the game, you may type **~info** to see your rank and the list of endings you\'ve obtained.\n\n\

Trost is at the southernmost point of Wall rose, the front line of humanity\'s defense. Your unit boasts that \
of the eight training corps attached to the various districts, yours is the most elite.\n\n\
You remember the tragedy of five years ago - a century of peace shattered by the attack of the Colossal Titan, \
and the destruction of the first barrier, Wall Maria. Humanity was forced to flee deep into its territory, \
losing 20% of its population...\n\n\
You were just a child then. That attack was the reason you joined the Training Corps. The training was painful \
and brutal, but all your classmates were good people.\n\n\
There was the boy **Eren**, devoted to destroying every last Titan. The girl **Mikasa**, with her extraordinary \
physical abilities. **Armin**, a boy small in stature but great in intellect... There was the gentle, thoughtful \
**Marco**, while Reiner, reliable and brotherly, earned the trust of everyone in the \
unit. **Annie** was reticent and hard to get to know, but she excelled as a soldier. You\'d like to enter the \
same regiment as her.\n\n\
Silly Connie and ravenous **Sasha** were fun, too. **Krista** was always kind to everyone, and then there was \
the tall but timid Bertolt... You wonder what unit they all hope to join.\n\n\

you\'re all going your separate ways, you can\'t help but feel a little sad...\n\n\

It was a book about the outside world, and Armin says it mentioned fiery water, a continent of ice, snowbound deserts... \
He says a strange word, one you barely know: *sea*.\n\n\
There\'s far more water in the \"sea\" than is in the canal. Probably enough to cover the entire area inside the walls. In \
fact, apparently the majority of the outside world is \"sea\", and the land rose up out of it. But even though the land \
covers less than half the world\'s surface, there is still vastly more of it than is contained within the walls.\n\n\

all out...\n\n\
You can hardly imagine it. It\'s like a myth, or a flight of fancy.\n\n\
You ask Armin if he really believes all that. He smiles sadly.\n\n\

The man is short, but his gaze is sharp, and he never seems to make an unnecessary movement. His very existence is somehow inspiring.\n\n\
You tell him where to find the command unit, and he spins on his heel and departs with his soldiers. You see the \"Wings of Freedom\" \
crest on his back - the symbol of the Survey Corps.\n\n\
A whisper runs through the camp: \"That\'s Captain Levi!\" Many sound deeply impressed.\n\n\
It wasn\'t possible to communicate with the Survey Corps once they left on their expedition; no one even knew where exactly they \
were. But they seem to have sensed that Trost was in trouble, and came back.\n\n\
Captain Levi is exceptional even among the elite troops of the Survey Corps. He\'s known as \"Humanity\'s Strongest Soldier\" \
and is said to be as strong as an entire brigade. You know rumor tends to exaggerate, but he sounds impressive nonetheless.\n\n\

    # You happen to overhear some passers-by chatting excitedly of a concert being held by a famous singer right here in Stohess. You don\'t \
    # follow this pop culture that has sprung up recently, but for lack of things to do, you decide to check it out anyway.\n\n\
    # Even though you arrived early, the concert hall was already packed. Getting in was a challenge, but you eventually made it.\n\n\
    # The curtains part to massive cheers, screams and applause from the audience.\n\n\
    # With a screen in front of them, you can only make out the silhouette of the lead singer. However, it seems oddly familiar somehow, \
    # as if you have seen them somewhere before.\n\n\
    # It was only when the screen is dropped that you realize why. To your utter amazement, you see *Annie Leonhart* in a stylish new outfit, who proceeded to dazzle \
    # the crowd with dance moves like you\'ve never seen before.\n\n\
    # You realize that this was the goal she had in mind all along, the purpose that kept her going in life.\n\n\
    # Astonishment gives way to joy, as you join the crowd in clapping along with the music and calling her name.\n\n\

To your astonishment, she\'s wearing the same expressionless look on her face she always had during training. Normally, this \
wouldn\'t surprise you, but under these circumstances, shouldn\'t she be a little concerned, at least-?\n\n\
Curious, you decide to approach her.\n\n\
"The situation is grim, I don\'t deny that, but what\'s the use in panicking about it?", Annie says to you.\n\n\
"Look over there." Annie points to the rest of your comrades. "The others are already formulating a plan to get us out of here. \
When the time comes to take action, we must be ready to perform at our best. One slip-up can get us all killed."\n\n\
"And in any case, even if I were to die in this place, I want to die knowing that I\'ve did my very best to fulfill my duty."\n\n\
She is right. To maximize your chances of survival, you cannot afford to make any mistakes. \n\n\
Talking to Annie gives you renewed confidence. However, you can\'t shake the feeling that her courage comes from elsewhere...\
perhaps she knows something that you don\'t?\n\n\
Nevertheless, you are impressed with how she has managed to keep a clear and cool head under such dire circumstances. This combined \
with her keen observational abilities was likely what propelled her to the top 10 of your graduating class in the first place.\n\n\

As you maneuver closer to check if she\'s alright, you realize that she wasn\'t actually \
shivering at all, but sobbing uncontrollably, her chest heaving with each sob. Between her sobs, she doesn\'t hear you land behind her.\n\n\
You are taken aback. You\'ve never seen Annie like this before.\n\n\
"I\'m sorry... I\'m so sorry..." you hear Annie mutter to herself.\n\n\
You see an extra set of maneuvering gear laying beside her. This must have belonged to the soldier whose death she had recently witnessed.\n\n\
You can\'t bring yourself to step forward and comfort her. After such a traumatic experience, she probably wants to be left alone right now.\n\n\

"Look at them, oblivious to the harsh reality of the world they live in. It does make all of this seem less pointless."\n\n\
You look at her quizzically. What was she trying to say?\n\n\
"Spending your entire life within this confined space. The Titan invasion. The reminder that your fate is completely at their mercy."\n\n\
She turns to look at you. "Have you ever wondered if there could be a point to all of this, something to justify all this death and destruction?"\n\n\
You find yourself unable to respond. Up till now, you have only been concerned about being a good soldier and doing your duty.\n\n\
But you understood what she meant. If humanity\'s extinction is inevitable, then what\'s the point of holding on to your dreams, holding on to life-?\n\n\
"That\'s what I thought in the past, anyway." Annie continued, as if picking up on your train of thought.\n\n\
"I had spent some time in the Interior before joining the military. While there, I met a man who showed me why that isn\'t the case. \
I still remember his words to me."\n\n\
*\'Every last person I\'ve seen was the same way.\'*\n\n\
*\'Whether it was booze, women, or even God.\'*\n\n\
*\'Family, the King, dreams, children, power.\'*\n\n\
*\'They couldn\'t keep going... unless they were drunk on something.\'*\n\n\
"I now understand what he meant. Life does not come with any meaning attached to it... everyone must find their own purpose in this world we live in. \
That\'s what keeps us all going in life despite the odds."\n\n\
She pauses, then says quietly, almost to herself,\n\n\
"And I am no exception."\n\n\
Annie tilts her head towards you. "So what keeps *you* going?"\n\n\
Without waiting for a reply, she takes off, leaving you to your thoughts.\n\n\
