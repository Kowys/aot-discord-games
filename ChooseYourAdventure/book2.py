The fight was hideously one sided, with Titans pressing in all around. Even the more experienced soldiers were dropping like flies with the guard unit in tatters. \
The one silver lining was that with their sacrifice, the soldiers bought time for the people to safely evacuate.\n\n\
In the midst of this chaos, a boy from the 104th Training Corps, Eren Yeager, transformed into a Titan. It allowed him to save his friends from danger, but even Eren didn‚Äôt seem to know how he had done it. \
When Commander Pixis arrived with reinforcements, he came up with a bold plan to use the Titan Eren as a ‚Äúliving weapon‚Äù to retake Trost District. \
The operation cost many lives, but ultimately succeeded. Eren, in his Titan form, used a massive boulder to plug the hole in the town gate.\n\n\
This was humanity‚Äôs first victory against the Titans.\n\n\
Eren, however, was not hailed as a hero. \
The other soldiers regarded him as something weird and dangerous; he was put to a court-martial, where some even suggested that he should be executed and his body dissected for science.\n\n\

Eren, eager to join the Survey Corps and exterminate the Titans, was often at loggerheads with Jean. Jean would always taunt Eren with this nickname, \
and it found a certain currency among members of the 104th Training Corps.\n\n\

You find this ridiculous. Why would Eren attack Mikasa if she were a Titan spy? The mood in the room was so tense that even such basic lapses of logic were being ignored, \
which was not going to benefit Eren in the least.\n\n\
The Military Police Brigade was among the first to suggest that Eren should be executed and an autopsy performed. Eren being Eren, he yelled something like, \
‚ÄúJust shut your mouths and invest everything in me!‚Äù Which, of course, didn‚Äôt help matters any.\n\n\
It was then (you‚Äôre told) that Captain Levi began kicking Eren mercilessly. Even those who had been calling for execution found a modicum of pity in their hearts at the scene, and so the wrath abated.\n\n\

No one is sure whether Levi‚Äôs burst of violence was an act arranged with Eren ahead of time, or a decision he made on the spot. \

The Female Titan, is hardly one to let such an opening slip by. She brings her leg up to head height, performing a roundhouse kick with tremendous speed.\n\n\

You assume the Female Titan must have hardened her foot for the vicious kick.\n\n\
Eren‚Äôs massive body collapses to its knees. The Female Titan approaches cautiously- then opens her mouth wide. You can hear a popping sound as the flesh of her cheeks tears. \
With her mouth open unnaturally wide, the Female Titan bites down on the neck of Eren‚Äôs headless body.\n\n\

Thankfully, there doesn‚Äôt seem to be anyone around; the streets are quiet. No one seems to have noticed you yet, but if anyone does, \

‚ÄúThat seems a little crazy. Anyway, wouldn‚Äôt it have been easier to escape before you came into Stohess District?‚Äù\n\n\
‚ÄúThis town has a complicated geography, and we were going to use it to our advantage,‚Äù Armin says without missing a beat. ‚ÄúAnd we weren‚Äôt going to just try to flee immediately. \
We were going to pretend to go along with them, get them to lower their guard, to buy us more time to escape.‚Äù\n\n\

‚ÄúThere. This is it,‚Äù Armin says. You‚Äôve come to a stairway just off the street that leads down into an ancient-looking tunnel. \

I should have just killed you and all the other humans. Then no one would‚Äôve suspected me.‚Äù\n\n\
The leaders of the Survey Corps surround Annie.\n\n\
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to be placed under the supervision of the Survey Corps. If you cooperate, nothing bad will happen to you,‚Äù Commander Erwin promises, but Annie gives him a spiteful laugh.\n\n\

If the Female Titan had appeared in the middle of Stohess District, the result might have been catastrophic.\n\n\
Problems remain, of course; a mountain of them. Eren‚Äôs custody is by no means resolved, and the capture of a new kind of human who can turn into a Titan will no doubt make the tribunal even messier.\n\n\
You don‚Äôt know what will happen to Annie now. She‚Äôs an enemy of humanity. Fortunately, however, she hasn‚Äôt yet killed any humans. Perhaps she could be enlisted to fight on your side as a Titan, just like Eren.\n\n\

Ymir, the girl who had been so close to Krista, was badly wounded in this battle. You hear she did something dangerous in order to keep Krista safe. Krista is ever at her side.\n\n\
When things finally settle down and you have a chance to tell her about what happened in Stohess District, she only says, ‚ÄúTo think Annie kept her true self hidden from us all that time‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n\
Just like the other members of your training squad, she seems surprised, but where you expected this kindhearted girl to be hurt, she seems to feel something else instead.\n\n\
‚ÄúHey,‚Äù Krista says then. ‚ÄúIf you found out that I had been deceiving everyone, too‚Ä¶ What would you do?‚Äù\n\n\
She‚Äôs staring right at you. Her clear blue eyes and beautiful golden hair are the same as ever‚Ä¶ And yet, she doesn‚Äôt look quite like the Krista you once knew.\n\n\
How will you answer her question?\n\n\

Have there been immobilized Titans inside the wall all this time?\n\n\
And how does a Wallist minister know about that, anyway? Have they been aware of the secret all along? Do they have information hidden even from the Survey Corps?\n\n\

‚ÄúWe in the Survey Corps have given everything for humanity. We haven‚Äôt begrudged even our own lives, if it holds out the slightest bit of hope! And somehow you knew about this, and kept silent! \
Do you know how many of my friends have been eaten by Titans?!‚Äù\n\n\
Hange looks ready to drop the minister off the 50-meter wall, and you don‚Äôt think the squad leader is just trying to intimidate him. The bright, cheerful Hange you know seems to have vanished completely.\n\n\

Above all, she can do it because the three of them trust each other implicitly, so much so that they can attempt something this outrageous without so much as a practice run.\n\n\
